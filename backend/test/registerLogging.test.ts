/**
 * A regression guard for item 16: registration must not write the
 * email-verification token to the log.
 *
 * The token verifies an account on its own, so anyone who could read the logs
 * could verify an account they did not own for the 30 minutes it stayed valid.
 * Reading the code proves it is gone today; this proves it stays gone.
 *
 * Runs the real `register` handler with its collaborators stubbed — no
 * database, no network, no SMTP — and inspects everything it printed.
 *
 * `sendEmailVerification` is destructured at module load in authController, so
 * mocking the exports object would not reach the local binding. The module is
 * replaced in `require.cache` before authController is first required instead.
